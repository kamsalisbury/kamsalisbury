## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am a senior Azure cloud engineer and PowerShell expert.

You can find projects I share here on [Github](https://github.com/kamsalisbury), my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kamsalisbury) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kam-reef-salisbury). Any applicable industry research is [ORCID identified](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3453-9587).

Please note that I am not affiliated with any other Kam on social media or blogging platforms. I am the original and unique Kam.

I am the author of a book called PowerShell for IT Helpdesk and Admins, which is no longer available for purchase.

I have a MBA in Information Management from Grantham University (2012) and several certifications in cloud, networking, and telepresence. You can check out my recent certifications [here](https://www.credly.com/users/kam-salisbury). Some of my older certifications include Novell Netware 4/5 CNA, Microsoft Windows Server/Exchange MCSE, and Cisco Telepresence Administrator SVS2.
